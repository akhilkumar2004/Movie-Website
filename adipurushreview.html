          I don't really need to explain about this film. Ever since the first teaser dropped, I knew this film would not work, due to <br>
          cartoon worthy the graphics were. It felt like whether you were watching Cartoon Network or Nickoldeon shows in India. Even an XBOX <br>
          360 or PS2 game has better grpahics than this monstrosity. I honestly feel bad for Prabhas since this is his hattrick flop film. I <br>
          cannot believe they sepnt 600 crores on this project! Makiung a name, as to this being the most expensive Indian film ever made, is a <br>
          an insult to Indian cinema. To Mr. Om Raut, you seriously should've considered not going all out with this film. Also this an adaptation of <br>
          the Ramayana gone wrong. The execution of this film went totally wrong. Can we also talk about the horribel representation of Ravana, as instead <br>
          of teh head alignment being straight, it is the exact alignment of a dozen og eggs? Overall, very disappointed, and to Om Raut, you ruined the Ramyana. <br>
