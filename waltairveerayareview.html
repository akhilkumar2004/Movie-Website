         Waltair Veeraya is a mass commerical action film directed by K.S.Ravindra (also goes by "Bobby"). The overall <br>
         film was surprisingly decent despite some flaws in both the first half and second half. It's great to see Chiru in a <br>
         more vintage look, because his other films he tries to act as of more mature for his role. Gladly, this was the comeback <br>
         deserved after a hattrick flop between Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy, Acharya, and GodFather. DSP's music is average but the BGM<br>
         was fantastic. We even got Ravi Teja in the second half as more of an extended cameo which served a double treat for fans. <br>
         My slight criticisms has to do deal with "age gap" between Chiru and the heroine, as it did generate some cringe scenes here <br>
         and there, but what you can expect from an old actor trying a vintage look? Overall Chiru fans can say BOSS IS BACK! <br>
