          Dear Thalapathy, 
          <br>
          <br>
          
          I heard the news. I just want to say a huge thank you for being the biggest Kollywood entertainer of <br>
          Indian cinema. Ever since the days when we watch your films in small theaters and on Sun TV, your acting, <br>
          charm, and style, would never fail to mesmerize us. You would often do all the good things for society and for <br>
          your fans. The speechs you give will always be remembered. The transition from Thalapathy to Thalaivar is a tough <br>
          transition. The transition from cinema to politics is a challenging level. Though I might not be a huge diehard fan, <br>
          you are true hero of Indian cinema. Though Rajinikanth is the Super Star, you might as well be. We will totally miss you from <br>
          the big screens, and remember all the films we would used to cheer and whistle upon. All the best for your political entry, and <br>
          make Tamilnadu great again!
        </p>
