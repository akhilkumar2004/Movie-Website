            <br>
            Maamannan is a political drama film directed by Mari Selvaraj, starring Udhayanadhi Stalin, Vadivelu, Keerthy Suresh, and Fahad Faasil. A powerful first half <br>
            but with a slightly let down second half. Cast performances were pretty good. But Vadivelu holy shit man, what a raw avatar.Music and BGM were fantastic. <br>
            The interval block was totally bonkers man. When it’s Mari Selvaraj you know it’s going breaking glass and shit! The dog and pig symbolism meaning both good and <br>
            evil man! Mari Selvaraj knows his symbolism! If only the second half could be a tad bit better then this would’ve been legendary. Overall another successful film <br>
            for Mari! <br>
