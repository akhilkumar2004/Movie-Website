            Originally, I thought of watching this in theaters, but I preferred Jigarthanda Double X, over this, in which <br>
            I still to this day was proud of my decision. Karthi, dude, wtf man. Why did you accept this? There was no story, just <br>
            robbery, both in the film, and in reality. Songs were even shit. Only praising the fact, that at least for a shit film, you <br>
            tried. Other than that, I am disappointed.
