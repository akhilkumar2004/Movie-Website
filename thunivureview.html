            For once I finally can redeem myself and say I actually enjoyed an Ajith movie. We used to ridicule and say that this was Beast 2. I  <br>
            sort of got hyped a lot because Ajith would be in a negative shade after a long time, Ghibrans songs and BGM would rule the movie, and <br>
            for once there would be no amma sentiment scenes. Ajith Kumar’s look by far has to be his best look. I really liked him having a beard <br>
            with plastic shades rather than him being clean shaven in Thunivu. First half was so entertaining in much aspects despite being fast. <br>
            Second half was average and bit of a letdown though. Especially the climax, where there were obvious illogical sequences. Another thing <br>
            I wished was at least provide more screen presence for Manju because she was wild, and the other supporting characters in the flashback scenes. <br>
            Other than that, Thunivu is also the epic Pongal winner for this year! Also please don’t tell me which movie is better. I enjoyed both these movies <br>
            fair and square despite them being made on a mediocre attempt. <br>
