            I was actually kind of surprised after watching this. I expected this to be a normal Balayya film, where <br>
            there wuold so many illogical scenes, but in reality, we got a normal narrative for Balakrishna film. For once, <br>
            Balakrishna is playing a role suitable for his age, FOR ONCE! Praise to the visuals and the action sets for this film. <br>
            But in a way, this kind of has the Darbar vibes, where the heroine would be 30 years younger, which we got for this, but <br>
            other than that, a FINALLY WATCHABLE Balakrishna film.
