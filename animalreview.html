            I really don't know where to start. This was the most painful film to go through. I appreciate Ranbir <br>
            Kapoor, but like bruh what was his written character? Bro was acting like some alpha male type guy. And also <br>
            Rashmika, what were those dialogues? This film had too much violence, too much PAPA, and too much lag. The first <br>
            half was tolerable, but the second half, I just gave up. The only goo thing, at least were the songs and BGM. That's it <br>
            Sandeep Reddy Vanga, I really liked Arjun Reddy, but you just went too extreme for Animal. Honestly my respect for you <br>
            has gone in the dustbin! Also if oyu have time, just watch his interviews, and you will get it.<br>
