            <br>
            Pathu Thala is an action drama film directed by Obeli N Krishna, starring Silambarasan TR and Gautham Karthik in the lead roles. <br>
            This film is a remake of the 2017 Kannada film Mufti. Overall an average and boring film. The plus points were definitely STR's role as AGR <br>
            and AR Rahmans powerful music and BGM. While the visuals are nice for a gangster film, the films writing and screenplay felt off at some points. <br>
            Overall an average remake. <br>
