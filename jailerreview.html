         Jailer is an action black comedy film written and directed by Nelson. I went first day first show with my family and my god it felt like <br>
         watching a film in India. The massive cutout, the cake celebrations, the whistles and cheering, it was truly a feast. Never did I expect to <br>
         see a massive fanbase in the USA for Rajinikanth. As a huge Thalaivar fan it's a dream come true! Jailer is definitely the comeback for not just <br> 
         only for Rajini but for Nelson Dilipkumar. His last film Beast failed to set expectations for the genral audiences and emerged as a major failure. <br>
         But now he made Jailer a lot more better than his predescor. Rajinikanth was so raw in this movie, which I absolutely liked since we got to see him in a <br>
         different avatar. Can I just say this man  never ages? HE'S 72! IT'S UNBELIEVABLE RIGHT? Anirudh's music and BGM definitely elevated, which is no surprise <br>
         composed by him.  The biggest surprise were definitely the cameo roles, especially Shiva Rajkumar and Mohanlal's. The interval was definitely out of the box, <br>
         but the climax, the climax was GOOSEBUMPS! There were slight criticisms in the second half where some scenes were unwanted and I felt like Tamanah and Sunil's characters were a waste, since they didn't correlate with the story. If only Nelson fixed that, then this film would've been his best in his career. Other than that, 
         Jailer is surely a winner for all audiences. <br><br>
