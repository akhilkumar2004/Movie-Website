           Whenever Nani does a romantic film, or an emotional drama, he excels. And in Hi Nanna <br>
           it's no different. The chemistry being him and Mrunal Thakur, was perfect. The songs were <br>
           such a vibe. The last 30 mins though, defintely hit everyone. This surely was the most peaceful 
           watch. <br>
