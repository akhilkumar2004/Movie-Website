         BRO is really just an average remake of an underrated Tamil film Vinodhaya Sitham. I respect Pawan Kalyam, but DUDE STOP DOING REMAKES MAN! <br>
         Like all you do remake a strong film and "commercialize" in a way. I'm not a huge Pawan Kalyan fan but all I know is that dude chooses the most interesting <br>
          scripts to not dissapoint  some fans. I will say for PK fans you will def get some references. For regular moviegoers, consider it an average film and get it <br>
          out of the way. Siai Dharam Tej did fine,but like dude just overacts in a way. Samuthikirani is the director for this film as well, and I will say he tried his <br>
          best. It just didn't match up the level of Vindhaya Sitham. Overall, strictly for PK fans!
