            A flop director, working with a struggling hero, will output a horrible film right? Wrong. This film <br>
            proved the haters that this film would not work. Although, the true hero was not Vishal, it was SJ Suryah. <br>
            Long live the SJ Suryah supremacy. LADIES MATTER AH? The whole unique concept of someone trying to call themselves <br>
            from the past, is quite something I didn't expect from the teaser. Usually Adhik Ravichandran films, would have adult <br>
            comedy and horrible romance, but this is different. It's a time machine gangster film, done right. Can I say the climax <br>
            was hilariously amazing! When Vishal came out with his anaconda turret? That's literally him after he finally made a good <br>
            after five years. Overall, I am really surprised! Welcome back Vishal! <br>
