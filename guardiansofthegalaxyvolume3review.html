            It was the end of the spring semester, so right of the bucket list I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 <br>
            and let me say it was a complete banger. Marvel is finally back to it's funny and heroic phase with this, and <br>
            for a conclusion to a triology, it was the best ending ever. The star of the show is Ratchet since the whole film <br>
            was based on him. Really glad that we finally got the Marvel comeback deserved, but this doesn't mean Marvel isn't <br>
            getting any better with the upcoming lineups. Other than that, donâ€™t call me 89P13, the name is rocketâ€¦ rocket raccoon. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ <br>
