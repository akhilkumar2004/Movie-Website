          Vaathi is a socio-drama film starring Dhanush, Samyuktha Menon, and Samuruthirikani in the lead roles, directed by Venky Atluri. The plot revolves<br>
         The plot revolves  on Balumurugan, a math professor, who gets transferred to a different school where he faces problems on the education<br>
          to the owner. How he saves this school and revives good education among students is the rest of the film. At first the plot looks mid but in reality <br>
          it actually is interesting in some scenes. The music of the movie was why this film became popular, especially the track Vaa Vaathi <br>
          and in Telugu, Mastaaru Maastaru. Dhanush is the saviour, but really it depends on whether you like it or not. For me, it felt mid. <br>
