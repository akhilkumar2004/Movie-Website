          King of Kotha was the biggest hyped film for Dulquer Salmaan. Unfortunately it didn't work for anyone especially me. Music and <br>
          BGM was fantastic at least, but the film felt way too long. Locking in at a three hour runtime, I know for a fact that when it comes <br>
          out on OTT, they will surely cut some scenes, just like what they did in Valimai. DQ tries his best, but fortunately he was only there <br>
          for a few scenes. If they had just made like "rise-to-a-gangster" type of films like Mahaan or KGF, then surely this would've of cliked on. <br>
          Instead they start with a flashback and then when the interval comes, DQ's new look arises. Overall, a massive disappointment.
