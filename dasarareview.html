            Dasara is an action thriller film, starring Nani and Keerthy Suresh in the lead roles, directed by Srikanth Odela. This film <br>
            was a mass comericial treat for all Nani fans, seeing this as Nani's first mass commerical film. The first half of the film was <br>
            fantastic, but followed by a poor second half. The climax shot was the highlight of this film. The music by Santhosh Naranyan <br>
            however, was a huge disappointment for me, considering I expect SaNa ot deliver bangers. The only song, that was good was Chamkeela <br>
            Angeelsi. The BGM was also subpar. This would have potential to be Nani's best film in his career, though it had its flaws. Overall, a decent <br>
            film. <br>
