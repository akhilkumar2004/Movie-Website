            Tom Cruise absolutely never misses. Ever since the very first Mission Impossible I have been following every single film, and this was amazing.<br>
            Not going to lie the plot for this film included a submarine, which was bad timing, because you know why. But let me just say the action scenes <br>
            were next level. Especially the scene where Tom Cruise jumps off a cliff while riding his motorcycle, it was epic. Definitely not the best Mission <br>
            Impossible film, but really dying to see Part 2 now. However, I am super worried about the box-office situation since a week later is Barbeheimer. <br>
            Really should've planned a different release date. But other than that, a promise for MI fans!
