            <br>
            Custody is an action thriller film, written and directed by Venkat Prabhu, starring Naga Chaitanya and Krithi Shetty in<br>
            in the lead roles. Venkat Prabhu usually delivers with unique concepts with some fun flavors, but this film was completely <br>
            different from his other works. The concept in this film was unique, but it was let down with writing and screenplay. <br>
            Expected a lot more comedic elements in a this film and also better music. Overall, a huge misfire from Venkat Prabhu. <br> 
            I am really scared about what Venkat Prabhu will do for Thalapathy 68.<br>
