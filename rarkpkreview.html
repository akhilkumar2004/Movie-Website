            I didn't much hope from this film, mainly because it is a Karan Johar film, but after watching this, I <br>
            was really surprised. This felt like as if this was some vintage Bollywood family drama. Karan Johar really <br>
            took us back in time! Ranveer Singh was surprisingly good, but the real star was Alia Bhatt. God damn she is <br>
            hot. Music was pretty nice, especially What Jhumka. Overall a Karan Johar surprise!
