          I had high hopes for this film, mainly because it is Shah Rukh Khan collaborating with the goat, Rajkumar Hirani. <br>
          But after watching this, I felt kind of disappointed. Well, I actualy fet disappointed with the "first drop" of this film, <br>
          by SRK's look in the film, because it reminded me of him in Zero, in which we know what happened to that film. I will say, the <br>
          music was pretty good. The emotional factor in this film, was a hit or miss for me, becausse there were some scenes that hit, while <br>
          others that didn't. This was kind of a high take, but old SRK scenes in this film didn't have to be 20 mins, I felt like this should've <br>
          been a post-climax scene. The main thing is that the Rajkumar Hirani effect is missing in this film. This could very well be his weakest <br>
          film. Overall a time-pass entertainer.
