            Kisi Ka Bhai Kisi Ki Jaan is an action film directed by Farhad Sahmji featuring Salman Khan and Pooja Hegde in the lead role. <br>
            The film is an official remake of the 2014 Tamil film Veeram. As someone who enjoyed Veeram, this film is a remake gone absolutely <br>
            wrong. I will say I will praise the action sequences and the inclusion of South India in this film which is fair game, but at the same <br>
            time has an injustice factor to it. For instance, the music of the movie is terrible, but what could be even wirse then adding a nursery <br>
            rhyme with a Telugu flavored vibe. Salman Khan delivered a somewhat cringe performance, and Pooja Hegde does nothing as usual. Villain <br>
            selection is really poor as they don't deliver the hype in this film. Overall, save yourself from watching this, and instead watch Veeram. <br>
