            Leo is a an action drama film directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj starring Thalapathy Vijay and Trisha in the lead role. The hype <br>
            for this movie was wild, since many people wanted to know whether this film was in the LCU or not. I will say this film is <br>
            not a proper Lokesh Kangaraj masterpiece like Vikram and Kaithi. If you want to know whether it is in LCU or not, do give <br>
            Leo a watch. The first half was incredible followed an average second half. Thalapathy's acting was incredible, and for once <br>
            I can say that it is his best acting since Kaththi. Anirudh yet elevates once again with unique BGMS and his songs. Sanjay Dutt <br>
            and Arjun Das were powerful but yet only had limited screen space. Also great to see my idol Trisha pair up with Vijay after 19 <br>
            years man! Man they both look cute on screen. The cinemtogrpahy was amazing but the VFX felt ok for me. I felt the hyena CGI could <br>
            be better, especially the first 10 minutes. There were some dragged boring scenes especially in the second half, in which they could <br>
            have removed, but honestly Lokesh tried his level best. Rest in peace the box office records! Also f**k the censor board.
