            Welcome back SRK! After five years, you proved your point! Seeing you back in a more mass look, is what you <br>
            call the best comeback. Forget the subpar VFX, some illogical action scenes, mediocre music, just watch it for <br>
            SRK. Also this is a John Abraham comeback, as well, as he delivered a terrific villainous performance. Bollywood <br>
            should consider him as more of a villain selection, than a hero selection. This film is under the YRF Spy Universe <br>
            which sort of intrigues me, to see all the big Bollywood stars meet up. Also the Salman Khan cameo as Tiger, was <br>
            a huge treat! Overall, SRK Zinda Hai! <br>
