          Barbie is one of those films that everyone was hyping for and from my experience, I surprisngly enjoyed it! I originally thought this film <br>
          would be an absolute injustice to make an live action film about a Mattel doll, but in Greta Gerwig we trust! Absolutely admired Margot Robbie's <br>
          performance as the real Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken. The plot follows as Barbie is slowly starting to malfunction because someone has been destroying <br>
          her Barbie in the real world. Barbie is set to embark on ajourney to find out who the Barbie owner was and meet them. However, while Barbie was gone. <br>
          Ken who tries to attempt to fall love in Barbie still manages to fail, and as revenge he decides to transforms Barbie world into Ken. <br>
          How will Barbie save the world of Barbieworld? Will Ken be able to find love with Barbie? I will note that yes, maybe Barbie must not be for everyone <br>
          considering it's a "girls" film, throufgh the whole Barbenheimer memes and hype, everyone for sure will be watching this! <br>
