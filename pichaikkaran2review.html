          Pichaikkaran 2: Anti Bikili, is a standalone sequel to the orginal Pichaikkaran, which was directed by Vijay Antony. There was so much <br>
          hype around this film, due to the craze over the original Pichaikkaran. Sadly though, this film was felt average. Same plot and storyline as the <br>
          original Pichaikkaran, but this time with charcter twists. Average music and BGM, didn't hit hard as the original Pichaikkaran. Overall, if you are <br>
          avid fan of Pichaikkaran, the sequel will disappoint you. Also what a coincidence that in the original Pichaikkaran that, the Indian govrnment decided <br>
          to remove 1000 rupee notes, and now in Pichaikkaran 2, the government decided to remove 2000 rupee notes. <br>
