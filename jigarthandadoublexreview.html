           Karthik Subbaraj, I bow down to you and I will touch your feet man. YOU ARE A LIVING GOD. This is <br>
           cinema. This is a masterpiece. THIS WAS AWESOME. Raghava Lawrence, you deserved this comeback. This is <br>
           what workig with actual good scripts can treat you. SJ Suryah was terrific as well, especially the climax. <br>
           Everything was there, emotion, drama, action, you know it. IF THERE IS ANY FILM CRITIC WHO GIVES THIS FILM <br>
           UNDER THREE STARS, I WILL BEAT THE LIVING SHIT OUT OF YOU. LEARN FROM THIS. THANK YOU KARTHIK SUBBARAJ!
