            I finally watched Varisu, and I must say one thing, watch this only for Vijay. Honestly to summarize this movie it’s a sandwich<br>
             of familiar Telugu movies. Dance venuma, dance irukku, fight venuma, fight irukku, Vijay sir body language venuma, adhi irukku, <br>
            finally emotions, adhi irukku. If they’d worked hard on the writing a bit more and made the second half less tolerable, Varisu <br>
            would’ve been a perfect family entertainer. Thamans music was above average but the BGM was wild. I really don’t expect Thaman the <br>
            to pull off bangers for Thalapathy! Rashmika appearing in less scenes was actually a good decision, since that would just stretch <br>
            movie and make it even more boring. Supporting cast was average in some sorts, which is expected in family dramas, BUT WHERE WAS <br>
            KHUSHBU?!!! I feel like they really should’ve deleted a lot of unnecessary scenes and put the KHUSHBU scenes in. Other than that,<br>
            Varisu is definitely a decent film with no big surprises.<br>
