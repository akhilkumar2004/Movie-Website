         To all Chandramukhi fans, especially me, after watching this, do you feel like your childhood film has been ruined? <br>
         Well I'll tell you for sure mine did. Why? Why a sequel? This is a wasted opportunity for Kollywood cinema. Raghava <br>
         Lawrence needs to stop doing horror scripts, and try something different. Like he attempted to do it with Rudran, but <br>
         it had the same elements as his other films. The comedy somewhat worked, but everything else was trash. Also bruh people <br>
         be praising Kangana Ranaut as Chandramukhi, but I seriously think someone more talented can play as Chandramukhi. Jyothika <br>
         was defintely the OG. Overall, very disappointed! Also the one star is only for Vadivelu.
