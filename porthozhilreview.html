            An amazing cop drama that lives to its fullest. Every scene, every frame was absolutely beautiful. A huge win <br>
            in the books for Kollywood cinema for creating low budget interesting films that captivate the audience this year. <br>
            Ashok Selvan and Rummy Nayagan Sarathkumar, being the most iconic duo, of course. But huge shoutout, to Sarath Babu, for <br>
            his powerful, but yet creepy villainious performance in this film. Overall, a must-watch.
