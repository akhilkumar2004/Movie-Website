            Vetrimaaran you beauty! After so long, he made another banger! The transformation from Soori being a full <br>
            on comedian to him being an actual hero, is unreal. Soori should definitely do more more heroic roles from now on <br>
            forth. Music and BGM by Ilayaraja was pretty good! This film is certainly not for everyone, since it has high violence and <br>
            misogny, but it's Vetrimaaran man, let the guy cook! Overall a sixer for Vetrimaaran! <br>
