         No words are needed to describe this monstrosity I saw. I remember in a interview that Meher Ramesh called Vedhalam a "cringe film". If you call <br>
         it a cringe film, then why the hell would you remake it? If you call this cringe, then I can call this ULTRA PRO MAX CRINGE. By far the worst acting <br>
         by Chiranjeevi man, it was a pain to watch. And also Keerthy Suresh as the sister role? Hadn't she not learned her lesson in Annaatthe? I'm gona bet <br>
         Siruthai Siva is laughing in the corner just watching this mess. Also the overall film's message is about women empowerment but did I see just see seducing <br>
         scenes in the flashback portions? Absolutely horrible. And then music, BRUH, the only saving grace in Vedhalam was Anirudh's music in which he gave instant <br>
         chartubsters, but the music here is SHIT. As someone who admired Chiranjeevi, I really don't why he would accept this film. Chiru please don't do any more <br>
         remakes, they are the distractions to your film career. Overall, please don't watch this. Even if you are a Chiru fan.
