            Is this the best Tamil film of 2023? Absolutely. The film focuses on the idea of human trafficking <br>
            and why it is severe. This could very well be Siddarths best film in his career after Jigarthanda. <br>
            The songs were excellent. I have been absolutely vibing to Kangal Edho and Unnakku Dhaan 24/7. The child <br>
            actress for Chittha, absolutely nailed her role. Whoever the heroine, is, you definitely put out the best performance <br>
            unlike other heroines. She was also in Jigarthanda Double X, and both films were her career best films. The film can <br>
            be disturbing for a few, due to its sensitive topic. But overall, this is a Kollywood winner.
